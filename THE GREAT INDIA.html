    <p> It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel, India offers a range of vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes, cuisine, faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even these vary as you journey from one state to another. As a country, India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress in the last 70 years of independence. The change is clearly visible in the Tier I and Tier II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark difference as you travel through the new and old parts of its cities. From world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls, restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities, filled with thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street food is a fascinating experience.</p>

    <h2>WalkThroughINDIA</h2>
    <p>
        With a history that dates back over 30,000 years, there’s no telling what you’ll find on a visit to India. Between the stunning architecture, unique and varied culture, mouth watering food, and ancient traditions, travellers who rank India at the top of their must-visit list can’t be blamed for wanting to experience some of this amazing country for themselves.While there are many ways to explore a country – cruising along rivers, prowling in a safari van, and enjoying an overland journey, to name a few – one of the best ways to truly get a feel for the culture and history of a region is to walk through it. After all, what better way to walk a mile in a local’s shoes than literally walking a mile in their shoes? Thankfully, India provides countless opportunities to explore the country by foot, and we, along with our friends at Exodus Travels, are here to provide you with a complete guide to walking through India.
    </p>

    <p>India’s weather is famously extreme, from large monsoons to scorching, dry summers. While India is certainly a year-round destination, travellers should consider their level of fitness and decide what kind of adventure they’d like to have before determining when they’ll visit the country. If an extreme journey trekking through mud under harsh conditions sounds like your perfect adventure, then you won’t have a problem travelling during monsoon season, which lasts from about July to September (however, note that a visit to the north of India around August will actually be fairly dry and pleasant, similar to a European summer). If you’re used to extreme heat and know how to properly hydrate and care for yourself when hiking long distances in those conditions, pre-monsoon, from April to June, might be perfect for you. However, travellers who don’t want to contend with any extreme weather, and enjoy a more accessible journey, would do well to plan their trip from the months of October to March, when temperatures are moderate and the weather is pleasant.</p>
